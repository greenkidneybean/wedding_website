# An Eight Year Love Saga
## From Katherine:

I saw Michael for the first time during my freshman year of college. He was tall, had a shock of hair that stood on end, wore orange crocs and owl sweaters, and had a huge smile. From then on, I had a crush. We were both biology majors, and I would try and catch him in the lab or leaving the Science Center on his way to the pottery studio. He was somewhat of a campus legend (ask me about it sometime...) so I didn't think my prospects were good. However, during junior year he spotted me at church, asked a friend for my number, and invited me on a hike. I was thrilled. The evening after the hike, I received a text message from him that read "that was lovely, letâ€™s do it again." It was sweet, and it was straightforward. I've never doubted his commitment in the eight years that have followed.

Since then, we have wandered everywhere together - both literal and metaphorical! We both pursued secondary education and maintained a long distance relationship, at times it was a "long hike relationship" as Michael pursued his dreams out West. In 2014, Michael moved to D.C. and our relationship blossomed. We have learned what it's like to be a team, to support each other, and to choose to love every day. This September, I'm thrilled to get to publicly seal the deal with my first and only love, surrounded by our friends and family!

## From Michael:
