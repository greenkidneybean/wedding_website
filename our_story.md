# Our Eight Year Love Saga
## From Katherine...

I saw Michael for the first time during my freshman year of college. He was tall, had a shock of hair that stood on end, wore orange crocs and owl sweaters, and had a huge smile. From then on, I had a crush. We were both biology majors, and I would try and catch him in the lab or leaving the Science Center on his way to the pottery studio. He was somewhat of a campus legend (ask me about it sometime...) so I didn't think my prospects were good. However, during junior year he spotted me at church, asked a friend for my number, and invited me on a hike. I was thrilled. The evening after the hike, I received a text message from him that read "that was lovely, let’s do it again." It was sweet, and it was straightforward. I've never doubted his commitment in the eight years that have followed.

Since then, we have wandered everywhere together - both literal and metaphorical! We both pursued secondary education and maintained a long distance relationship, at times it was a "long hike relationship" as Michael pursued his dreams out West. In 2014, Michael moved to D.C. and our relationship blossomed. We have learned what it's like to be a team, to support each other, and to choose to love every day. This September, I'm thrilled to get to publicly seal the deal with my first and only love, surrounded by our friends and family!

## From Michael...


So you want to hear a bit about when I realized Katherine was the one? Well I’ll tell ya, but it does get a little mushy...

It was the summer of 2013 on the banks of the Illinois River. You probably already know this, but Katherine loves fish - so much so that that’s what she chose to base her graduate thesis on. And if Katherine is going do a science project you can bet your bottom dollar that there’s going be some field work involved. I joined naively, because I thought maybe she could use the help and a week on the river sounded like fun (because, ya know, Katherine’s pretty fun).

On this particular night, we were at the end of our third day of processing Asian carp. Processing Asian carp means that we had measured, weighed, and cut into hundreds of fish in the heat of July in central Illinois (yes, it was exactly as smelly as you're imagining). After a full day of this mushy work, we were back at America’s Best Value Inn weighing carp body parts on a scale in the bathroom. I looked at her and realized I was really, really in love. Throughout the years we had been dating, I’d swooned over Katherine plenty of times, but this swooning session was different. I realized that (1) Katherine is one tough nugget, (2) if you’re an Asian carp you’ll wanna keep your distance, and (3) we shouldn’t be having nearly as much fun as we were.

Katherine brings a lot of laughter to life, and it’s one of the many, many things that I love about her.

### So What's the Deal With "Toubers"?

Great Question!  You may be thinking we're just huge potato fans with a terrible sense of spelling, but what we're really going after is a mash of our surnames, __Tou__zinsky and Cham__bers__, TOUBERS!
