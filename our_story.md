# An Eight Year Love Saga
## From Katherine:

I saw Michael for the first time during my freshman year of college. He was tall, had a shock of hair that stood on end, wore orange crocs and owl sweaters, and had a huge smile. From then on, I had a crush. We were both biology majors, and I would try and catch him in the lab or leaving the Science Center on his way to the pottery studio. He was somewhat of a campus legend (ask me about it sometime...) so I didn't think my prospects were good. However, during junior year he spotted me at church, asked a friend for my number, and invited me on a hike. I was thrilled. The evening after the hike, I received a text message from him that read "that was lovely, letâ€™s do it again." It was sweet, and it was straightforward. I've never doubted his commitment in the eight years that have followed.

Since then, we have wandered everywhere together - both literal and metaphorical! We both pursued secondary education and maintained a long distance relationship, at times it was a "long hike relationship" as Michael pursued his dreams out West. In 2014, Michael moved to D.C. and our relationship blossomed. We have learned what it's like to be a team, to support each other, and to choose to love every day. This September, I'm thrilled to get to publicly seal the deal with my first and only love, surrounded by our friends and family!

## From Michael:

So you wanna hear a 'lil about when I realized Katherine was the one?  Well I'll tell ya, but it does get a little mushy.

It was the summer of 2013 on the banks of the Illinois River.  Katherine and I had taken a break for a few months prior (to be expected when one takes a long hike in the woods) but Asian carp brought us together.  Katherine loves fish, like so much so that that's what she chose to base her graduate thesis on.  And if Katherine is gonna do a science project you can bet your bottom dollar that there's gonna be some field work involved.  I joined naively, because I thought like she could use the help and maybe it could be fun (cause, ya know, Katherine's pretty fun).

It was at the end of our third day of processing Asian carp (I say that a bit too lightly because processing Asian carp means that we've got piles of dead carp lying around a picnic shelter, attracting any fly in central Illinois that's capable of producing maggots, and we were dissecting gonads (if it's not apparent at this point, let me emphasize that this is a very mushy process)), and we were back at America's Best Value Inn (the Wenona location) weighing carp testicles on a scale in the bathroom.  I'd swooned over Katherine plenty of times before, but this swooning session was different.  I realized that (1) Katherine is one tough nugget, (2) if you're an Asian carp you'll wanna keep your distance, and (3) we shouldn't be having nearly as much fun as we were.

Katherine brings a lotta laughter to life, and it's one of the many things I love about her.
