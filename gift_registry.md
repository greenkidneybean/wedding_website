The biggest gift you could possibly give us is love , support, and prayers as we take this huge leap into married life! We want you to know that your presence at our wedding is SO precious to us.  

For traditional gift givers, we've registered for a few things we need.  If you're inclined, we've also registered for a charity donation to Project Congo, a non-profit that serves critical medical needs in Africa. It is run by an emergency doctor in Dayton, OH, named Dr. Sylvia Gleason. Michael traveled to Africa with Project Congo in 2013 and the experience opened his eyes to how blessed we are. We'd like to use this opportunity to give to those who feel they have been forgotten.
