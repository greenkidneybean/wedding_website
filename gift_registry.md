Having our loved ones make the effort to celebrate our marriage with us is a huge gift. We really couldnâ€™t ask for anything better.

Our biggest challenge with registering for traditional gifts is that while Michael is getting his PhD, we plan to live in a small apartment with few storage options. That said, we will cherish anything sentimental or creative and we have registered for a few fun and useful things on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/wedding/katherine-touzinsky-michael-chambers-granville-september-2018/registry/GE7URJ26FE8N).
