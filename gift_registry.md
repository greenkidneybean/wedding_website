Having our loved ones make the effort to celebrate our marriage with us is a huge gift and there's truly nothing better that we could ask for.

Our biggest challenge with registering for traditional gifts is that we plan to live in a "cozy" apartment with limited storage options. That said, we will cherish anything sentimental or creative and we have registered for a few fun and useful things on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/wedding/katherine-touzinsky-michael-chambers-granville-september-2018/registry/GE7URJ26FE8N).
