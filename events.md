# The Wedding Ceremony - September 1st

Mass: Our wedding ceremony will be a full Catholic Mass. We know this may be a learning experience for our non-Catholic friends but have no fear! We will have a program ready so you know exactly what's happening (and we do, too!).  

Phones & Cameras: We would like to ask that everyone is in-the-moment for the ceremony - for us, this means leaving your phones in your pocket or bag so we can see your smiling faces. After the ceremony - feel free to document anything and everything!  

After the Ceremony: Please wait for a while church after the ceremony is over for to cheer us on as we head out into the world as a married couple!
