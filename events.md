# Wedding Ceremony - September 1st, 2:30pm

Mass: Our wedding ceremony will be a full Catholic Mass. We know this may be a learning experience for our non-Catholic friends but have no fear! We will have programs available so you'll have a pretty good idea of what's going on.  

Phones & Cameras: We would like to ask that everyone is in-the-moment for the ceremony - for us, this means leaving your phones in your pocket or bag so we can see your smiling faces. After the ceremony - feel free to document anything and everything!  

After the Ceremony: Please wait for a bit at the church after the ceremony is over to cheer us on as we head out into the world as a married couple!
