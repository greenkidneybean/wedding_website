# The Bridal Party

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Daniel Touzinsky - Man of Honor</b></p>

Daniel is Katherine's brother, and with that comes several very important titles: chief of operations for neighborhood games, flashlight tag point person, confidant, total goofball, and longest-time friend.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>James Touzinsky - Groomsman</b></p>

James is the brides brother & the life of the party. His arrival in the Touzinsky household brought a lot of joy and an extended stay for Santa Claus, Gus the leprechaun, and other magical houseguests. While he doesn't believe in them anymore, heâ€™s 100% likely to quote memes, have great fashion (obviously) and be up on the latest dance moves

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maura Campbell - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Maura is an cool, calm, and collected lady who does not shy away from the quirky (100% a requirement to be bbf's with the bride).  She's turned her eye for the unusual into a passion - something you'll witness if you're lucky enough to catch one of her video art exhibitions. She's been a source of inspiration and silly jokes for Katherine since '02!

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Erin McKenna - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Erin has been the bride's friend for 20 years. They grew up on Liberty Lane and brought quite a bit of ridiculous fun to the heart of Ohio's 'burbs. She's often moved to tears over beautiful colors, and lights up the world with passion, dedication, and zest everywhere she goes!

<img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/valerie.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Valerie Vogt - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Valerie is the bride's friend and roommate from the wonderful days at Wittenberg University.  She may look innocent, but Val is the instigator of many a dorm room dance party. She'll knock your socks off with deadpan humor and can make a costume out of everything. Literally, anything.
