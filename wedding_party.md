<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Daniel Touzinsky - Man of Honor</b></p>

Daniel is Katherine's brother, and with that comes several very important titles: chief of operations for neighborhood games, flashlight tag point person, confidant, total goofball, and longest-time friend.

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>John Chambers - The Best Man</b></p>

John is a stud, but don't let it get to his head.  
What I love about him is that he's always down for an adventure, and what's even is that he has an incredibly high tolerance for adventures gone wrong (ask him about our kayaking trip to Kelly's Island).  He's my best friend and I'm honored to have him as my best man.  
:muscle:

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Sean Bresler - Groomsman</b></p>

Sleeeeeeeeezy B!  A connoisseur of purple and lasers, and I dare to say he's  merfolk at heart.  On a punny note, he's brought a lotta magic to my life.  Sean's the most honest person I know and I still get infected by his enthusiasm for any given topic (lately it's been Magic the Gathering, and Trump conspiracies). Also, Sean has graciously allowed our wedding date to be shared with his birthday (Sept. 1st!), so definitely wish him a Happy Birthday when ya see him!
:birthday:

<br><img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/maura.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maura Campbell - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Maura is a cool, calm, and collected lady who does not shy away from the quirky (100% a requirement to be bbf's with the bride).  She's turned her eye for the unusual into a passion - something you'll witness if you're lucky enough to catch one of her video art exhibitions. She's been a source of inspiration and silly jokes for Katherine since '02!

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Danny Chambers - Groomsman</b></p>

Danny boy, this kid is a ball of fun and he does it with style!  What I love about Danny is that he's always down to toss around ideas, and a sometimes a baseball at the same time.  He's also got a wonderful sense of humor that could lighten the family mood on even the worst of days (or hikes).
:laughing:

<br><img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/erin.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Erin McKenna - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Erin has been the bride's friend for 20 years. They grew up on Liberty Lane and brought quite a bit of ridiculous fun to the heart of Ohio's 'burbs. She's often moved to tears over beautiful colors, and lights up the world with passion, dedication, and zest everywhere she goes!

<br><img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/molly.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Molly Riffon - Bridesmaid</b></p>

I'm super proud of Molly for so many reasons!  She found a wonderful spouse (Paul is an absolute gem, I'll get to him next), she just graduated and is now officially a physical therapist, and she brought all the dogs into our family!  I was thrilled to be a part of her wedding and I'm thrilled yet again to have her be a part of mine.
:dog: :dog:

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Paul Riffon - Groomsman</b></p>

Paul is not only the newest addition to our family, but a true gem!  I'm totally getting ahead of myself here because I still need to ask him if he'd be game to be a groomsman (asking him this weekend after Molly's graduation, fingers crossed he says YES!), but regardless, this is just a lovely opportunity to say how pumped I am to have a new brother (not that the old brothers are duds, cause they're definitely not) and I'm hoping he can help me improve my woodworking skillz!

<br><img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/james.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>James Touzinsky - Groomsman</b></p>

James is the brides brother & the life of the party. His arrival in the Touzinsky household brought a lot of joy and an extended stay for Santa Claus, Gus the leprechaun, and other magical houseguests. While he doesn't believe in them anymore, heâ€™s 100% likely to quote memes, have great fashion (obviously) and be up on the latest dance moves.

<br><img class="centered-and-cropped" width="200" height="200" style="border-radius:50%" src="/assets/wedding_party/valerie.jpg" >
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Valerie Vogt - Bridesmaid</b></p>

Valerie is the bride's friend and roommate from the wonderful days at Wittenberg University.  She may look innocent, but Val is the instigator of many a dorm room dance party. She'll knock your socks off with deadpan humor and can make a costume out of everything. Literally, anything.
