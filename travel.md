For guests who are coming from far out of town - we are SO thankful for the effort you're making to join us.

**From CMH to Granville:**

The easiest way in and out of Granville is the Columbus International Airport. Once you arrive at CMH, Granville is an easy 1/2 hour drive away. We recommend coordinating with other attendees and booking a rental car for the weekend.
